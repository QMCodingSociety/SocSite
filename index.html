                The Queen Mary Coding Society is here to create a community of coders and computer programmers within the university. Programming has a wide range of applications and we aim to explore some of them through exciting social and educational events including bi-annual hackathons. Whether you want to learn to code, pick up a new language or develop your already existing skills, we will have a range of events to cater to all skill sets. </br> Follow us on social media, join our mailing list and whatsapp group chat to stay updated and informed! https://linktr.ee/qmcodingsoc
